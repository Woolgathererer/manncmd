CVE: CVE-2019-14287

Platform: Linux

Type: Privilege Escalation

Brief Introduction:   In Sudo before 1.8.28, an attacker with access to a Runas ALL sudoer account can bypass certain policy blacklists and session PAM modules, and can cause incorrect logging, by invoking sudo with a crafted user ID. For example, this allows bypass of !root configuration, and USER= logging, for a "sudo -u \#$((0xffffffff))" command.

Affected Version:   Sudo before 1.8.28
